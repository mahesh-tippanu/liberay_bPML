K-NN (K-Nearest Neighbors) Machine Learning
Build Status
This repository contains the implementation of the K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN) algorithm for classification and regression tasks in machine learning.

You can explore the code and examples in this repository. The implementation is designed to be user-friendly and adaptable for various datasets.

Requirements
Building and running the K-NN algorithm requires Python and the following libraries:

NumPy
Pandas
Scikit-learn
Matplotlib (for visualizations)
To install the required libraries, you can use:

bash
Copy code
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib
Building
To run the K-NN implementation, clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/k-nn.git
cd k-nn
Example Usage
To classify a sample dataset using K-NN, run the following command in a Python environment:

bash
Copy code
python knn_classifier.py
You can modify the knn_classifier.py script to change the dataset, K value, and distance metric.

Visualizing Results
To visualize the results of K-NN, you can use the following command:

bash
Copy code
python plot_results.py
This will generate visualizations of the K-NN classification or regression outputs.

Running Tests
To run unit tests for the K-NN implementation, execute:

bash
Copy code
python -m unittest discover -s tests
Contributing
We welcome contributions! Please see the CONTRIBUTING.md file for guidelines on how to contribute to this project.

Translations
Help with translating the documentation is appreciated! See the Translations label in the issues to join in efforts that are currently in progress. If you want to start a new language, open a new issue!

Spellchecking
To check the documentation and source files for spelling errors, you can use the spellcheck.py script available in the ci directory. It requires a dictionary of valid words, which can be found in ci/dictionary.txt. If the script identifies a false positive, add the word to ci/dictionary.txt while maintaining alphabetical order.
